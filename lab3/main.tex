\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	This lab aims to investigate data acquisition via sinusoidal signals and the
	errors involved therein. We first investigate the affects digital sampling
	frequencies have on the measured data and the use of the Nyquist Frequency.
	Because generated signal have errors within themselves we also investigate the
	effects of amplitude, y-axis offset, and quantization errors in obtaining the
	signal.
