\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}

This lab shows that digital sampling of analog sinusoidal waves is not a naive
operation. Firstly the Nyquist frequency theorem states that for a minimum
accurate representation of a sampled wave must be sampled at a frequency twice
that of the sampled wave. We also show that aliasing introduces signifigant
error ($\approx 8\%$) in amplitude and null-offset of the wave. Finally we show
that quantization error can reduce details or leave out information entirely
from the sampled wave; depending on the quantization amplitude range and bin
size.
