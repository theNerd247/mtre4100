\section{Simulation of Generated Sampling Frequencies}
The experiment started with simulations using LabVIEW. The simulation
consisted simply of a single function generation block. The block was set to
generate a sine wave at 100 Hz, sampled at 80 Hz. \figref{part1_1}

	\caption{Simulated Signal With Sampling Rate of $80\dem{Hz}$}
	\label{fig:part1_1}
\end{figure}

The sample rate was then adjusted to $200\dem{Hz}$ to show how sample rate
affects how the resulting signal appears. Notice that in \figref{part1_2} the
signal appears while in \figref{part1_1} it does not. This is due to \Labview
having a fail-safe where it will not generate a signal that cannot be properly
sampled. Next we will investigate why this is in place.
