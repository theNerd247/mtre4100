	\section{Simulation}
	The experiment started with simulations using LabVIEW. The simulation consisted simply of a single function generation block. The block was set to generate a sine wave at 100 Hz, sampled at 80 Hz. The sample rate was then adjusted to show how sample rate affects how the resulting signal appears. This was also used to show how LabVIEW will not allow a function to be sampled below the Nyquist frequency.
