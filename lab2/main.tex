\labTitle{Lab 2 Fourier Transforms}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	The purpose of this lab is to show how Fourier Analysis can be applied to
	periodic functions to represent them in a form better suited for further
	analysis. Many real world signals, for instance, are not continuous. This can
	make analysis using transforms such as the Laplace and z-transforms difficult,
	as integrating discontinuous functions requires special techniques and care.
	The Fourier Analysis approach simplifies this process by representing a
	function as a sum of sine and cosine functions. Sine and cosine functions are
	easily manipulated in other forms of analysis and are the preferred forms to
	use. 
	
	In this experiment we look at the specific case of a square wave that
	oscillates between 1 and -1 over a constant period. This kind of wave is found
	in abundance in digital electronic systems and has a simple Fourier transform,
	convenient for this experiment
