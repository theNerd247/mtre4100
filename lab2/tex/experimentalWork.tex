	\subsection{LabView File}
	
	The LabView file was constructed using function generators, output graphs, and
	summing junctions. The function generators were set to produce sine waves at
	the correct amplitudes and frequencies to produce the first four harmonics of
	the square wave; the first generator for the first harmonic, the second
	generator for the second harmonic, and so on. The summing junctions were set
	up to add the functions sequentially; the first junction added the first and
	second harmonics, the second junction added the third harmonic to their sum,
	and the final junction added the fourth harmonic to their sum. The output
	graphs were placed after the first generator and after each summing junction.
	This way, the graphs would show the sums of the harmonics.
