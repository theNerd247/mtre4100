\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}

From the simulations performed we found that a $8^{th}$ order Butterworth filter
removes the higher order frequencies from a signal and in our case leaving a
signal resembling a square-wave with a phase shift. We also find that the
\Labview simulations are useful for visualizing the affect of multiple terms in
a Fourier series. We found that the more terms in a series the closer the
combined Fourier signal resembles the original signal.
