\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}

Model predictive control has been an important step in controlling both linear
and nonlinear systems with internal and environmental constraints. The detriment
of MPC is that its computation time is rather slow and the prediction tuning can
become rather complicated. Sample-based MPC are a novel algorithm for use in
industrial and mobile robotic settings that optimizes the prediction step of the
MPC algorithm. The benefit of SBMPC algorithms - aside from optimized prediction
- is that by sampling the control and input space more constraints can be
handled by the system with the same manner of efficiency. A proposed application
is the use of SBMPC algorithms to perform kinematic control of serial robots for
simultaneous path planning and object avoidance.
