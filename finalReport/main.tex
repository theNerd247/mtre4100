\begin{abstract}

	Today many Industrial systems are controlled using feedback-loop based
	controls; commonly, the PID and state-space controllers. There are draw-backs
	however as PID controllers tend to be difficult and error prone in tuning and
	optimizing.  Novel approaches to control systems have been made in recent
	years which incoorporate sample-based path finding algorithms (typically the
	A$^{*}$) with model predictive controllers (MPC). We discuss the applications
	of sample based MPCs in industrial robotic applications.
