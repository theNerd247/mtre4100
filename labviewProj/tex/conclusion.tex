\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}

\Labview is a useful tool for generating simulations of systems involving
control processes. In this project we were able to simulate calculations of flow
through a pipe by using tempurature and pressure PID controllers (which
simulated measurments from a system which included noise). After tuning each PID
controller to be under-damped we then ran a simulation to show the calulation of
the water flow given desired tempurature and pressure settings.
