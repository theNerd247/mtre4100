\section{Final Project Design} 
\label{sec:final_project_design}

The final design of the measurement system contains two PID controllers, one for
temperature as shown in the previous section, and a second for pressure
measurement. The final diagram is shown in \figref{finalDiagram}. The output
from the pressure and temperature are used to calculate a prediction of the
fluid flow rate (per \eqref{flowRate}) in the pipe.

\end{figure}

The transfer functions for the final simulation are as shown in \tabref{coeffs}.
And the PID values are shown in \tabref{pids}. Both PID controllers are
connected to a noise-filter which filters the simulated noise at $10\dem{Hz}$.

A sample of the front panel during operation is shown in \figref{frontPanel}.
There are two things to notice about the sample plot. First, the smoothing of
the noisy inputs for the system. While both temperature and pressure sensor
inputs show a busy signal with lots of noise, the filters from the noise-filter
diagrams produce a final smooth curve that is useful for analysis. Second, the
response behaves as expected; the curve in the middle of the plot is indeed 
behaving as mathematically expected: below pressure and above the temperature plots.
