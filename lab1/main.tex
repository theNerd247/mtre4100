\begin{abstract}
	This lab aims to analyze the properties of first and second order differential
	equations both analytically and experimentially (using \Labview). First we
	note how differential equations arise naturally from physical systems and are
	useful in modeling physical behavior. Second we show that electrical filters
	have transient responses that are ignored in preference to their stead-state
	responses.
