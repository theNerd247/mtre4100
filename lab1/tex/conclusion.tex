\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}

From both experiments in our lab we find that the filter created doesn't simple
filter out the desired frequencies of a signal. That is the signal wasn't flat
from $t = 0$ but instead had a transient response. Under some circumstances this
can be ignored as a low response time works well for most applications.
