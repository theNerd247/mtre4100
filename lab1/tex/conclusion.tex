\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}

From both experiments in our lab we find that the filter created doesn't simple
filter out the desired frequencies of a signal. That is the signal wasn't flat
from $t = 0$ but instead had a transient response. Under some circumstances this
can be ignored as a low response time works well for most applications. From the
experiments perfomed we determined that \Labview is sufficient for modeling both
first and second order ODE systems. Percent errors were less than $\%10$ for the
first order systems and less than $\%2$ for the second order system.
